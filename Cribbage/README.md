# Cribbage-Bot
Cribbage is a card game that primarily relies on selecting an optimal
4-card hand from 6 inital cards.  My roommate and I play the game on a mobile app 
a lot, and we both feel that the app's AI isn't very good.  We want to 
make something that can beat the machine.

The purpose of this code is to create a program that, given the initial hand, can return the optimal cribbage hand, taking into the various aspects of score as well as the unknown cut card.
